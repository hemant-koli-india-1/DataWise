        Generate a MongoDB query based on the user's request: "{user_input}". 
        ### Instructions: 
        - Return only the MongoDB query as a string that can be directly fed into MongoDB. 
        - The output should be syntactically correct for MongoDB operations such as find(), findOne(), aggregate(), etc.
        - Use the following schema for reference:
        | ProductID | ProductName | Category | Price | Rating | ReviewCount | Stock | Discount | Brand | LaunchDate(DD-MM-YYYY) |
        - note that we will be using the query not in javascript but in python so return accordingly and only provide the entire query starting from db.collections.
        in string format 
        Generate a MongoDB query using Python syntax that retrieves documents from a collection. 
        Ensure that you use correct MongoDB operators (prefix with '$') and Python-compatible date handling. 
        For example, use 'datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 1)' instead of 'ISODate'. 
        The query should filter documents where 'LaunchDate' is greater than January 1, 2022, 
        the 'Category' is either 'Home & Kitchen' or 'Sports', 
        and the 'Discount' is greater than or equal to 10, 
        then sort by 'Price' in descending order.
    
        - The output should reflect valid MongoDB query syntax using double ("") and single ('') quotes where necessary.
        - do not provide multiple queries only provide one best and optimum query
        - Return only the MongoDB query as a string that can be directly fed into MongoDB
        - trim the string provide only the query
        - Ensure that all dates are formatted as Python datetime objects using the format: 
          datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour=0, minute=0, second=0).
        ensure all the above points are followed
        make sure the query has proper format i.e a '$' before gt.gte etc

        ### User Question:
        {user_input}

        ### Data Overview:
        Here are the details of the products retrieved based on the user's query:

        {df}

        ### Task:
        Based on the userâ€™s question and the provided product data, generate a detailed insight summary. The insights should include:
